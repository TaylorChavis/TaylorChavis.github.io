          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Contrast: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The site uses clashing neon colors and inconsistent fonts
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is no navigation bar to efficiently maneuver around the website.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repetition: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The header is too big and isnt connected to the top of the website. It feels like a banner that is blocking the view.
                </li>
                <li>The order page is incredibly overwhelming and confusing to navigate</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Alignment: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The site does not conform to mobile or split screen views.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The top and bottom margins could be improved upon.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion: </strong> Penny Juice does not implement the CRAP web design in any meaningful way.
            The site is overwhelming, outdated, and overall feels unprofessional which reduces trust in the product.
            The design is not mobile friendly and lacks user interface standards. Overall, the site is very poorly designed and could benefit from completely starting over.
