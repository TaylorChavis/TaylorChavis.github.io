          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Design:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Contrast:</strong> The color scheme makes it easy to read and provides good contrast between the text, navigation, and footer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Repetition:</strong> The font-family is suitable for the page. Headers are bold and makes it easy to understand what information the user is reading.
                <li>
                  <strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment of the page feels off-center and could benefit from padded margins. Having the navigation bar to the left of the page is a nice touch, however, it would be better to not scroll to the side to see the main content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proximity:</strong> It would be good to use less horizontal spacing between the nav bar and the main element. Vertical spacing is perfect.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Page:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Page contains header, main, and footer. Footer should not contain the itis3135 site links.</li>
                <li>
                  h1 is the name of the website and the h2 is the
                  name of the page
                </li>
                <li>The main element is sectioned well and portrays organization</li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Requirements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Has five functional pages</li>
                <li>The home page is listed under index.html</li>
                <li>The nav bar is functional</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conclusion</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    The FAQ portion of the site provides a drop down with provided information and makes for easy info look up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The calendar portion is a nice touch and shows a good working knowledge of java.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  Unfortunately, none of the images are working on the site and there are a few html errors on the schedule.html. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall the site is good but could use a few tweaks to make it more user-friendly.
